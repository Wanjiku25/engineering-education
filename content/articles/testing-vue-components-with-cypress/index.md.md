 ### Introduction
**Cypress** is a front-end testing tool for the current web that uses JavaScript. Its purpose is to make testing an application less complex for developers and quality assurance experts.

Using Cypress, we'll learn about Vue Component testing.

### An explanation of what a component test file is and how it is used.
As the name suggests, component testing is testing the most reduced or the smallest unit of any application.

Here's an illustration of a Cypress components test that includes some of the aspects we'll go through:
```javascript
import { mount } from '@cypress/vue'; 
import PrivatePoliteNote from './PrivatePoliteNote.vue'; 
describe('PrivatePoliteNote', () => {
 
 it('gives that topic', () => {
 
 mount(PrivatePoliteNote); 
 
 // certify that certain text is present at the appropriate header level
 cy.contain('h01', 'Private Polite').should('be.viable'); 
  });

 it('whenever the confirm button is pressed, it triggers the "confirm" event.', () => {
 
 mount(PrivatePoliteNote);

 
 cy.contain('button', '/^OK/') // locate a button object with the label OK on it.
    .click() 
    .vue() 
    .then((wrapper) => {
 
 expect(wrapper.emitted('confirm')).to.have.length(01) 
 
    });
  });

});
```
Some comments concern the user interface, while others concern the developer interface.
As developers, we will verify what events are released whenever we wish to target particular elements with appropriate textual content for the `UI.` This also means we'll test the component to make sure Vue produces it.

### Testing components
Many stages of testing are used to determine who will use a piece of code, and the terms of the agreement are with that individual. 

Now, let's focus on testing componets, this includes two contracts:
- The part is working to the developer if the **expected needs are conducted relying upon client input or different activities.**
- If the `UI` works for you as a developer, `UI` **reflects the posit of the component at all time**.

### Testing Vue components  with and without Cypress
A part may be mounted, can configure its setting, and various elements that a party may rely on to function properly can be faked out using Vue Test Utilities. Moreover, it provides a covering item for the mounting portion, making it a little simpler to assert what is novel about it.

With jsdom, Jest may set up the mounting portion in a programming environment and run the tests. As cypress' part test sprinter mounts vue parts using Vue Test Utils, the primary difference between the two methods is setup. Cypress is through with end-to-end test and it's functional.

This suggests we can watch our tests run, stop them in the middle, associate with the application and realize that the program APIs our application depends on are genuine program conduct, not jsdom imagined portrayals of similar abilities. 

Will mimic every client's cooperation, and Cypress will declare how the application will respond. 

We can make certain claims regarding the Cypress cover provided by Vue Test Utils.
It is possible to test the part's usefulness as a client without writing any system-specific code. We can use Vue Test Utils to mount the part and observe specific structure progression on an as-needed basis without composing any system-specific code.

You should never assume that a `$nexttick` from Vue will refresh the condition of the component after you've done something Vue-explicit.

### vuetify importation
There is a plugins subfolder in that repository that contains plugins that generate veutif entities and a plugins directory that contains plugins that do not.

It is, however, possible that our test setup will import it and then utilize it to mount the component that is being tested. Instead of using the regular mount method, Cypress has provided a command that may be found in the application's repo.

Here's the code we'll all need if we're going to perform everything in commands. We won't use the Vue Test Utils mount function directly in our tests because this is a bespoke implementation. We'll use our own cy. Mount command instead.

```javascript
// the vue-test-utils mount method is wrapped in the Cypress mount function.
import { mount } from "@cypress/vue"; 
import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuetify from 'vuetify/lib/framework';

Vue.use(Vuetify);



Cypress.Command.add("mount", (ModuleMounted, option) => {
 return mount(ModuleMounted, {
 vuetify: new Vuetify({});, 
    ...options, 
  });
});

```
The Vuetify app will be with us at all times, allowing us to pass in any additional settings we need for any of our installed components.

### Adding Vuetify's needed characteristics
Vuetify components anticipate being rendered in a certain **DOM** context. v-app> is the app's root element, and everything else is encapsulated within it.

We can handle this in a number of ways, but the simplest is to add some setup in your command before it mounts a component.

```javascript
Cypress.Commands.add("mount", (ModuleMounted, options) => {
 
 const root = document.getElementById("__cy_root");

 if (!root.classList.contains("v-application")) {
 root.classList.add("v-application");
  }
 
 root.setAttribute('data-app', 'true');  

return mount(ModuleMounted, {
 vuetify: new Vuetify({}), 
    ...options,
  });
});
  ```

Cypress's requirement to establish a root element, to which your component can be attached in order for it to work properly, can be used to your benefit in this situation.

Your component's root element, which has the ID __cy root, is the parent element of the root element in question. This provides everyone with a convenient location to add the classes and features that Vuetify anticipates will be present. Vuetify-based components will now appear and perform as expected. 

A flex display property exists in the needed v-application class. Can mount some unacceptable visual side effects on a single element, which you must override before actually installing the part:

  ```javascript
 root.setAttribute('style', 'display: block');
  ```

At this point, we'll be done adjusting the surrounding environment so that components may be mounted.

### How can we acquire the specs?
Configuration files like the one given here are frequently used in component testing examples, as seen below:

```javascript
  {
 "fixturesFolder": false,
 "componentFolder": "src/components",
 "testFiles": "**/*.spec.js"
}
```
If this is the case, look in any folder for files ending in.spec.js.
You can remove some unnecessary spec.js files from the node modules folder by appending them with the following:

```javascript
"testFiles": "!(node_modules)**/*.spec.js"
```

### Command file conflict
Use the techniques above to enable Vuetify to function with our component tests resulting in a problem.

Put everyone's orders into the same bucket. Your normal end-to-end testing js file. That's why your end-to-end testing couldn't get started. One of the imports has a minor issue in order to perform component testing.

Recommendation: put the mounting order and its conditions in its record and only use it in component tests when necessary.
Only one drawback to running both sets of tests is that it is easy to remove it from the overall context.

### How to get into the Vue Test Utils wrapper
The Vue evaluation The Utils wrapper is provided as Cypress in the context of a component test. Use cy. Wrap to make the output chainable when making assertions using it.
Commands.js now includes the following:

```javascript
Cypress.Commands.add('vue', () => {
 return cy.wrap(Cypress.vueWrapper);
});
```
May use this in a test similar to this:

```javascript
mount(SomeComponent)
  .contains('button', 'Do it at once')
  .click()
  .should('be.disabled')
  .vue()
  .then((wrapper) => {

 expect(wrapper.emitted('the-thing')).to.have.length(01);
  });
  ```
As soon as you start using the user interface, it becomes evident that this is distinct from the Vue Test Utils wrapper's subtlety analysis.

With Cypress, familiarity with its tools is more important than familiarity with its software.
Libraries such as Mocha, Chai, and others are wrapped in Cypress to make it easier for users to use them. That means we can get you the support and documentation you need because we're an outsider open-source arrangement with our documentation arrangement.

### Conclusion
As shown in this tutorial, there are so many additional open-source tools in the testing environment that can be used in conjunction with Cypress to test Vue components.

Even if you don't have a thorough understanding of the various instruments used, you may quickly get ready for action with Cypress.
